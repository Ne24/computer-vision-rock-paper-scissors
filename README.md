# Computer Vision RPS


This model was created through the use of Teachable Machine, It will be used in a rock,paper,scissors game 
It consists of four classes:

1. Rock
2. Paper
3. Scissors
4. Nothing

The machine was taught to recognise different selections, through the use of a series of images taken for each class,

for Rock, a clenched fist was held up to the webcam and rotated to capture the representation of the rock option
for Paper an open palm was held to the camera to capture the selection of paper 
for Scissors the first two fingers were presented to the camera to represent the scissors option
for nothing no expression of the hands were presented to the camera, this is a representation of no repsonse in a game of rock-paper-scissors
